Z80 Shield project

This is a Z80 shield. Information is here:

The PCB is powered by the Mega when it is plugged in and by a USB socket when running standalone as a single board computer.
Only run from one USB socket at a time, i.e. don't plug the PCB USB in if there's a Mega attached (powered or not).

This is a work in progress, two of the latest V2.0 PCBs have been built and work. It's a medium difficulty build, there's some surface mount and the flash chip is a package that isn't the easiest to solder but nothing too impossible.

Let me know about any problems.
