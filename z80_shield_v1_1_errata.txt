Errors on V1.1 PCB

1. SW0 and SW1 should go to MEGA so we can write to PIO
2  A_CLK should go to mega
3  A_RESET should go to mega

Fixed above on V1.2 PCB


4 INT needs pullup for stand alone operation
5 NMI needs pullup  for stand alone operation


4,5 fixed in V1.2

6. No vref for A/D

7. Unconnected lines on 74ls138
8. MAPRQ lines requires OR gate

9. BUSRQ named as BUSREQ on Z80 so no net
10. IORQ named as IOREQ on Z80 so no net

11. PIO CE commoned up
12. Mega fp wrong.
13. 74ls138 enables not connected
14. MAPREQ signal needed
15. Better oscillator may be needed
16. Move Z80 up a bit
17. crystal needs better space
