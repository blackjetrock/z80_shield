Cutting Tracks
==============

As per email to AM:

I've never cut a track before. You might think it's trivial, but I started
with questions. How hard do I need to press? Will a scratch do or do I need my
Dremel with a diamond bit? (I'm itching to find a reason to use one of those.) 
Only one way to find out. Scalpel applied.

Um, have I done it correctly? How do I tell? So I started chasing tracks along
the board and through the vias, getting more and more frustrated with how hard
this was. So I gave up on that and started poring over the schematic (now
making more sense). I started to understand.

U9-8 (SW1) is connected to U40-2. U9-9 is connected to U40-14. I checked these
with my multimeter on the 2nd board you gave me (the one I hadn't
touched). Correct! I checked them on the board I'd cut. Connections still
there! Huh? I checked my cuts with the loupe and decided I hadn't cut deep
enough. So I had another hack and checked again. Connections severed! Huzzah!

Then I checked again with the loupe and noticed I'd scratched at the track
above U9-8's. Oops. See attached. Chasing it along the board I found it goes
to U42-10, which according to the schematic it joins to D2. I checked, and
yes, mine is still thus connected. Phew.


Soldering Flash
===============

Device is a MBM29F040 512KB device, U7 on the schematic (towards the
bottom). The PCB is marked with both a cut off corner and a dot on one
side. Orient the device correctly. Clamp or tape the chip into position. Get
it absolutely right before you begin soldering. You can remove the clamp or
tape once you've got a handful of the pins soldered.

There's a knack to soldering such tiny joints. Each to their own,
but I put the smallest point on my soldering iron, then put it at the base of
the pin/pad, touched the solder to it, then flicked the iron tip upwards, up
the pin, the moment the solder melts. A bit of the solder goes around the pad
and the excess harmlessly coats the pin.


Soldering A/D Converter
=======================

Device is a MCP3008 8 channel analogue to digital converter, U14 on the
schematic. FIXME: what's it for? Looks like a facility for the shield, is it
used on the board?

Another tricky soldering exercise, and different shape to the flash
chip. The idea is much the same: clamp it, solder a couple of pins carefully,
then remove the clamp and do the others. It's easier than the flash because
the pin and pad it connects to are easily visible and accessible.

Pin 1 isn't marked as square on the PCB. I'm going by the D shaped cutout on
the PCB white lining and the dot on the surface of the IC here.


Voltage Regulator
=================

Device is an LM1117 3.3V voltage regulator, U37 on the schematic (left
side). This reduces the normal 5V which the whole board uses to 3.3V. Its 3.3V
output is used for one purpose: to provide 3.3V to the Arduino shield
connector. Some shields require 3.3V, and that's the only reason this
regulator is necessary. It's not used anywhere else on the rest of the board.


SM Capacitors C1-C5, and C12
============================

These 6 capacitors are all 100nF. (Mine are 220nF which Andrew says are fine
for this purpose.) They bridge the 5V and ground lines in various places to
smooth current flow.

The first time I tried to solder one I picked it up with tweezers and it went
ping. No idea where that one landed and it's not going to be possible to find
it. Lesson learned. I have some spares. I picked up another one. :) The
technique is to lay down a little bit of solder on one pad, pick up the
component with tweezers in the left hand, melt that little bit of solder using
the iron in the right hand, then position the component into the melted
solder. The other end is then simple. It's not as hard as it sounds, but the
loupe is essential (for my eyes) so I can ensure it's bridging the gap between
the pads on the PCB.


SM Capacitors C6-C7
===================

These 2 capacitors are 22pF and are part of the oscillator which generates the
Z80's clock when the board is running in single board mode (i.e. when the board,
not the Arduino, is providing the Z80's clock).


C8, C9, C10
===========

Not fitted in the current design, see Bill of Materials for clarification.


SM C11
======

This is a 1uF capacitor used in the reset switch circuit.


SM Resistor C17
===============

The original design had this as a capacitor, but it's been updated and this is
now a 4.7K resistor. It retains its 'C' designation from the original
design. See the Bill of Materials for clarification.


C13, C14, C15
=============

Not fitted in the current design, see Bill of Materials for clarification.


D1
==

Not fitted in the current design. Bill of Materials confirms "nopop".


LEDs
====

The 2 LEDs, D2 and D3, the last of the surface mount component. These have to
be soldered the right way round (or they won't work) and the right way up (or
you won't see the light!).

The cathode is marked with a green tag. That goes towards the Dx label on the
PCB. Use a multimeter in 200ohm mode: touch the red probe to the end of the
LED nearest the R13/R14 resistor and the black probe to the other end. The LED
should light.

(Check with Andrew whether this all applies to all types of SM LEDs.)


Resistors
=========

We mounted resistor C17 earlier, it's a surface mount one. The rest are
conventional size and easier to deal with.

There are 8 1K ohm pull up/down resistors: R1, R2, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11 and
R12.

R3 is described on the schematic as 1M ohm, but is in the Bill of Materials as
6.8K ohm. 6.8K is correct, and is supplied in the box. That one's part of the
oscillator.

R6 is 4.7K ohm and is part of the reset circuit.


Crystal
=======

U36 is the 4.5Mhz crystal which clocks the Z80 when the board is running in
standalone mode (i.e. not connected to the Arduino). It can be mounted either
way round, but with v2.0 boards needs to be mounted a bit above the other
circuitry because there's not quite enough room for it to sit flush on the
board. Later boards have had a slight redesign of the layout and this isn't a
problem.


Sockets
=======

All the ICs are socketed, making them easy to put in place. The sockets need
to be soldered to the board, but they're very straightforward. The only thing
to watch for is the cut out 'D' at one end. That should match the white line
graphic on the board. This is not because the socket needs to be a certain way
round, but because the IC which plugs into the socket needs to be a certain
way round. Keep it simple - get the sockets matching the board graphics.

A lump of plasticine helps to hold the socket in place while you turn the
board over and solder one pin. That's then normally enough to keep the socket
in place while you go down the line soldering all the pins to the board.


Shield Sockets
==============

There are 4 lines of socket connectors for any standard Arduino shield to plug
into. These are simple to solder into place, again using plasticine or tape to
hold them while you solder the first pin. Take a little extra time with these
to ensure they line up squarely. Shields will be difficult to plug in if the
connectors aren't correctly aligned.


Arduino Connectors
==================

The Arduino connector pins are on the underside of the board, and hence
soldered into place from the top. Access to these can be a little tight given
that the IC sockets are already in place.


Fix Wires
=========

The tracks which were cut in step 1 now need to be reconnected to the connect
place. We're connecting the Arduino's pins 6 and 7 to U40 pins 14 and 2
respectively.

The Arduino pins 6 and 7 are digital GPIOs 2 and 3 on an Arduino Mega. The
Arduino software will use these to ... <do something>. They're being directed
to U40, the <something> for <some reason>.


Plug in the ICs
===============

The final task is to plug the ICs (the "chips") into their sockets. U1, the
big one towards the bottom left of the board is the Z80. We're using a Toshiba
variant for this project. The other two big ones are U9 and U11, which are the
parallel IO devices. U12 is the medium sized Zilog CTC chip towards the bottom
right. That's the timer device. The other medium sized chip towards the centre
left is U8, the 32KB RAM. We're using an Alliance chip for this project. The
rest are smaller, logic devices.

The legs of the chips rarely line up perfectly with the sockets first
time. Press them gently against the table top to bend them into
shape. Alternate sides so the legs remain a 90deg to the side of the IC.
