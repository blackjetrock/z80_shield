Errors on V2.0 PCB

1. SW0 and SW1 should go to MEGA so we can write to PIO
2. NMI should go to external connector
3. SPI connector needed in Arduino footprint plus SPi signals from PIO
4. XTAL space needed
5. Move resistors away from USB socket and keep area clear

6. Check INT signal OK

7. CONN4 and CONN5 labels reversed on PCB
8. MISO twice on shield connections
9. RESET not connected on shield
10. AREF not connected on shield
11. Add free running LED
12. Remove MAP LEDs
13. Data bus is reversed on port c. Makes it slower to do direct port access
